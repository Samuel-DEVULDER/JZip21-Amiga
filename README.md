Lots of games are available on the [IF-archive](https://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/), but I'd also like to notice about [zifmia](https://github.com/jeffnyman/zifmia) as well.

# Compiler 

If you need an Inform compiler, you can try [this one](https://github.com/Samuel-DEVULDER/Inform6-Amiga) for the Amiga ;)
